Installation:
tar -xzf logscan-1.x.x.tar.gz
cd logscan-1.x.x/
sudo python setup.py install

You could specify different formats logscan automatically check the logfile for.
Have a look at /usr/local/etc/logscan.conf.

usage: 
  logscan -h
  logscan logfile -i
  logscan logfile [OPTIONS]

exemples:
  logscan logfile -H 4 30  or  logscan logfile -t 4 30
                        from 4 hours and 30 minutes before last 
                        log-entry till the end of file
  logscan logfile -s 0105 2210 -m 50
                        from 5.1. 22:10 o'clock till 5.1. 23:00 o'clock
                        (50 Minutes further)
  logscan logfile -e 23 -w 2 0 5
                        from two weeks and 5 hours before the date of the 
                        last entry at 23:00 o'clock till this then

Get time-specific access to log-files, while rotated logfiles that are counted
up (e.g. logfile.log, logfile.log.1, logfile.log.2.gz ...) are automatically
taken together -even if they are gzipped. Different date-time-formats are
supported, inclusive simple timestamps as a huge number of seconds with three
decimal-places, e.g. 123456789.123.

positional arguments:
  logfile

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --info            show Informations about the LOGFILE
  -s VALUE [VALUE ...], --start-time VALUE [VALUE ...]
                        If there are two VALUES the first one is interpreted
                        as an expression for a date and the second one for a
                        time. If there is only one VALUE it is taken as an
                        expression for a time and the date will be
                        supplemented with the date of the last entry of the
                        logfile. VALUES can be given in various formats.
                        Exemples for dates are: 120123 --> 23.1.2012, 12:0123
                        --> 23.1.2012, 12-01-23 --> 23.1.2012, 20120123 -->
                        23.1.2012, 12-1-23 --> 23.1.2012. Missing values will
                        be complement to the last possible date in the past.
                        For the following exemples we take the 16.01.2012 as
                        the actual date: 03 --> 03.01.2012; 22 --> 22.12.2011;
                        0315 --> 15.03.2011 Times are handled in a similar
                        way. But when you dont get at least three numbers out
                        of the VALUE, then the given ones are taken first as
                        hour, second as minutes. For exemple: 120530, 12;5;30
                        or 1205-30 are all taken as 12:05:30 o'clock. 1205 or
                        12:05 is 12:05:00, and 12 is simple 12:00:00. You are
                        free to use any delimiter you want. Or no delimiter.
                        But then you have to care to use only double-digit
                        numbers like "05". The datetime you get will specify
                        the start of the output. So you can use -s with only a
                        single digit and you get the log of the day of the
                        last log-entry from the hour of the digit on.
  -e VALUE [VALUE ...], --end-time VALUE [VALUE ...]
                        works the same way as --start-time, but specify the
                        end-time of the output.
  -t N [N ...], --time-span N [N ...]
                        First N is interpreted as the number of hours, second
                        as the number of minutes, third as the number of
                        seconds while the second and third number is optional.
                        All together will be interpreted as a timespan, that
                        will be either add to the start-time if given by
                        --start-time, or subtracted from the time where the
                        logfile ends or if given from the specified end-time
                        (see --start-time and --end-time). Mention that all
                        data given by the Options --time-span, --weeks,
                        --days, --hours, --minutes are add up to one timespan,
                        that is used as descriped above.
  -w N [N ...], --weeks N [N ...]
                        The given Numbers are interpreted the same way as for
                        --time-span with the difference that the first N is
                        interpreted as the Number of weeks, second as the
                        Number for days, then hours, minutes, seconds. Only
                        the first N is required.
  -d N [N ...], --days N [N ...]
                        Same as --weeks but start with days.
  -H N [N ...], --hours N [N ...]
                        Same as --weeks but start with hours.
  -m N [N ...], --minutes N [N ...]
                        Same as --weeks but start with minutes.
  -D N [N ...], --date N [N ...]
                        Print the log of a specified day.
  -S FORMATSTRING, --strf FORMATSTRING
                        use FORMATSTRING to parse the date ("%Y-%m-%d
                        %H:%M:%S")
  -g PATTERN, --grep PATTERN
                        Only lines where PATTERN was found will be printed.
